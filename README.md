# Naqeebali Shamsi

Software Engineer | Full-stack & Cloud | Toronto / Dubai  

I build reliable systems and enjoy working across the stack — from distributed backends to mobile apps. My focus is on **cloud platforms (AWS, GCP)**, **scalable architectures**, and **developer-first design**.  

### What I’m working on
- Exploring **serverless and containerized workflows** for scale and cost-efficiency  
- Building with **React Native / Expo** for mobile experiences  
- Experimenting with **AI-powered developer tools** and **automation scripts**
